## TODAY
------
* structuring programs and hiding details
* functions
* specifications
* keywords: `return` vs `print`
* scope

## HOW DO WE WRITE CODE?
------
* so far
  - covered language mechanisms
  - know how to write different files foe each computation
  - each file is some piece for code
  - each code is a sequence of instructions

* problems with this approach
  - easy for small-scale problems
  - messy for larger problems
  - hard to keep track of details
  - how do you know the right info is supplied to the right part of code

## GOOD PROGRAMMING
------
* more code not necessarily a good thing
* measure good programmers by the amount of functionality
* introduce **functions**
* mechanism to achieve **decomposition** and **abstraction**

## EXAMPLE - PROJECTOR
------
* a projector is a black box
* don't know how it works
* know the interface : input/output
* connect any electronic to it that can communicate with that input
* black box somehow converts image from input source to a wall, magnifying it
* **ABSTRACITION IDEA**: do not need to know how projector works to use it 

------
* projecting large image for Olympics decomposed into separate tasks for separate projectors
* each projector takes inputs and produces separate output
* all projectors work together to produce larger image
* **DECOMPOSITION IDEA**: different devices work together to achieve an end goal

# APPLY THE CONCEPTS TO PROGRAMMING
------
## CRAETE STUCTURE with DECOMPOSITION
------
* in projector example. separate devices
* in programming, divide code into **module**
  - are **self-contained**
  - used to **break up** code
  - intended to be **reusable**
  - keep code **organized**
  - **keep code coherent**
* this lecture, achieve decomposition with **functions**
* in a few weeks, achieve decomposition with **classed**

## SURPRESS DETAILS with ABSTRACITION
------
* in projector example, instructions for how to use it are sufficient, no need to know how to build one
* in programming, think of a piece of code as a **black box**
  - cannot see details
  - do not need to see details
  - do not want to see details
  - hide tedious coding details
* achieve abstraction with **function specifications** or **docstrings**

## FUNCTIONS
------
* write reusable piece/chunks of code, called **functions**
* functions are not run in a program until they are **"called"** or **"invoke"** in a program
* funciton characteristics:
  - has a **name**
  - has **parameters** (0 or more)
  - has a **docstring** ( optional but recommended)
  - has a **body**
  - **returns** something

## HOW TO WRITE and CALL/INVOKE A FUNCTION
------

```python
def is_even(i):						# def-> keyword, is_even -> name, i -> parameter or arguments
    """
    Input: i, a positive int				# specification, docstring
    Returns True if i is even, otherwise False		# 
    """
    print("inside　is_even")				# body
    return i%2 == 0					#

is_even(3)						# later in the code, you call the function using its name and values for parameters
```

## IN THE FUNCTION
------

```python
def is_even(i):
    """
    Input: i, a positive int
    Returns Ture if i is even, otherwise False
    """

    print("inside is_even")				# run some commands
    return i%2 == 0					# return -> keyword, i%2 == 0 -> expression evaluate and return
```

## VARIABLE SCOPE
------
* **formal parameter** gets bound to the value of **actual parameter** when fuction is called
* new **scope/frame/environment** created when enter a function
* **scope** is mapping of names to objects

```python
def f(x):						# x -> formal parameter
    x = x + 1						# Function definition
    print('in f(x): x =', x)				#
    return x						#

x = 3							# Main program code : initialize a variable x, makes a function call f(x), assigns return of function to variable z
z = f(x)						# x -> actual parameter
```
