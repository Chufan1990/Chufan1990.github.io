## TODAY
------
* have seen variable types: `int`,`float`,`bool`,`string`
* introduce new **new compound data types**
  * tuples
  * lists
* idea of aliasing
* idea of mutability
* idea of clonig

## TUPLES
------
* an ordered sequence of elements, can mix element types
* cannot change element values, **immutable**
* represented with parentheses

```python
te = ()				# empty tuple
t = (2, "mit", 3)
t[0]				# -> evaluates to 2
(2, "mit", 3) + (5, 6)		# -> evaluates to (2, "mit", 3, 5, 6)
t[1:2]				# -> slice tuple, evaluates to ("mit", )	# extra comma means a tuple with one element 
t[1:3]				# -> slice tuple, evaluates to ("mit", 3)
len(t)				# -> evaluates to 3
t[1] = 4			# -> gives error, cannot modify object
```

* conveniently used to **swap** variable values

```python
# wrong example
x = y
y = x

# correct example 1
temp = x 
x = y
y = temp

# correct example 2
(x, y) = (y, x)
```

* used to **return more than one value** from a function

```python
def quotient_and_remainder(x, y):
    q = x // y				# integer division
    r = x % y
    return (q, r)
(quot, rem) = quotient_and_remainder(5, 4)
```

### MANIPULATING TUPLES
------
* can **iterate** over tuples

```python
def get_data(aTuple):
    nums = ()					# empty tuple
    words = ()					# empty tuple
    for t in aTuple:
	nums = nums + (t[0],)
	if t[1] not in words:
	    words = words + (t[1],)
    min_n = min(nums)
    max_n = max(nums)
    unique_words = len(words)
    return (min_n, max_n, unique_words)
```

## LISTS
------
* **ordered sequence** of information, accessible by index
* a list is denoted by **square brackets**,`[]`
* a list contains **elements**
  * usually homogeneous (ie, all integers)
  * can contain mixed types (not common)
* list elements can be changed so a list is **mutable**

### INDICES AND ODERING
------

```python
a_list = []
L = [2, 'a', 4, [1,2]]
len(L)					# -> evaluates to 4
L[0] 					# -> evaluates to 2
L[2] + 1 				# -> evaluates to 5
L[3]					# -> evaluates to [1, 2], another list!
L[4]					# -> gives an error
i = 2
L[i-1]					# -> evaluates to 'a' since L[1] = 'a' above
```

### CHANGING ELEMENTS
-------
* list are **mutable**
* assigning to an element at an index changes the value

```python
L = [2, 1, 3]
L[1] = 5
````

* `L` is now `[2, 5, 3]`, note this is the **same object**`L`

### ITERATING OVER A LIST
------
* compute the **sum of elements** of a list
* comman pattern, iterate over list elements

```python
total = 0
for i in range(len(L)):
    total += L[i]
print total
```

```python
total = 0
for i in L:
    total += i
print total
```

* notice
  * list elements are indexed `0` to `len(L)-1`
  * `range(n)` goes from `0` to `n-1`

### OPERATIONS ON LIST - ADD
------
* **add** elements to end of list with `L.append(element)`
* **mutates** the list!

```python
L = [2, 1, 3]
L.append(5)				# -> L is now [2, 1, 3, 5]
```

* what is the dot?
  * lists are Python objects, everything in Python is an object
  * objects have data
  * objects have methods and functions
  * access this information by `object_name.do_something()`
  * will learn more about these later
* to combine lists together use **concatenation**, `+` opertator, to give you a new list
* **mutate** list with `L.extend(some_list)`

```python
L1 = [2, 1, 3]
L2 = [4, 5, 6]
L3 = L1 + L2				# -> L3 is [2 ,1, 3, 4, 5, 6], L1, L2 unchanged
L1.extend([0, 6])			# -> mutated L1 to [2, 1, 3, 0, 6]
```

### OPERATIONS ON LISTS - REMOVE
------
* delete element at a **specific index** `del(L[index])`
* remove element at **end of list** with `L.pop()`, returns the removed element
* remove a **specific element** with `L.remove(element)`
  * looks for the element and removes it
  * if element occurs multiple times, removes first occurrence
  * if element not in list, gives an error

```python
L = [2, 1, 3, 6, 3, 7, 0]		# do below in order
L.remove(2)				# -> mutates L = [1, 3, 6, 3, 7, 0]
L.remove(3)				# -> mutates L = [1, 6, 3, 7, 0]
del(L[1])				# -> mutates L = [1, 3, 7, 0]
L.pop()					# -> returns 0 and mutates L = [1, 3, 7]
```

### CONVERT LIST TO STRINGS AND BACK
------
* convert **string to list** with `list(s)`, returns a list with every character from `s` an element in `L`
* can use `s.split()`, to **split a string on a character** parameter, split on spaces if called without a parameter
* use `''.join(L)` to turn **a list of characters into a string**, can give a character in quotes to add char between every element

```python
s = "I<3 cs"				# -> s is a string 
list(s)					# returns ['I', '<', '3', ' ', 'c', 's']
s.split('<')				# returns ['I','3 cs']
L = ['a', 'b', 'c']			# L is a list
''.join(L)				# returns "abc"
'_'.join				# returns "a_b_c"
```

### OTHER LIST OPERATIONS
------
* `sort()` and `sorted()`
* `reverse()`
* [and many more!](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datasturctures.html)

```python
L = [9, 6, 0, 3]
sorted(L)				# -> returns sorted list, does not mutate L
L.sort()				# -> mutates L = [0, 3, 6 ,9]
L.reverse()				# -> mutates L = [9, 6, 3, 0]
```

### MUTATION, ALIASING, CLONING
------
* [Again, Pyhton Tutor is your best friend to help sort this out!](http://www.pythontutor.com/)

### LIST IS MEMORY
------
* lists are **mutable**
* behave differently than immutable types
* is an object in memory
* variable name points to odject
* any variable pointing to that object is affected
* key phrase to keep in mind when working with lists is **side effects**

### AN ANALOGY
* attributes of person
  * singer, rich
* he is known by many names
* all nicknames points to the **same person**
  * add new attribute to **one nickname**
Justin Bieber | singer | rich | troublemaker
  * ...**all his nicknames** refer to old attributes AND all new ones
The Bieb | signer | rich | troublemaker
JBeebs | singer | rich | troublemaker

### ALIASE
